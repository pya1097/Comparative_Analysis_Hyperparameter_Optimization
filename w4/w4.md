Q1) Does SMO do better than the random baselines (see prints 1,2,4)?

Ans) Yes, SMO  performs better than random baselines. The SMO output [2305.34, 16.58, 29.50] (print 5) and [2110.0, 17.9, 50.0] (print 6) for random seed 2705, has lower d2h than the random baselines [4380.0, 12.1, 20.0] (print1), [3830.0, 15.2, 20.0] (print2) and [2592.0, 18.5, 20.0] (print4). We were able to see this behaviour for most of the seed values.

Q2) How many y-row evaluations are required for (print 3)?

Ans) We need to avaluate all 398 rows to print 3, for finding the best value. We need to look through all the rows to find the y value with least d2h.

Q3) how does SMO do compared to absolute best (print 3)?

Ans) while comparing the absolute best [2130.0, 24.6, 40.0] to the average best (print 5) and optimal best (print 6) outputs given by SMO we can saay that the print 5 values are very close to the absolute best with a very little variance whereas the print 6 values are closer to absolute best but there are few outliers which lie very fr from absolute best. 
eg:- 
5: mid: [2569.7542662116025, 16.46313993174062, 26.962457337883965] 
6: top: [1950.0, 19.0, 30.0]
3. most: [2130.0, 24.6, 40.0]
